# Pull Requests

## Creating A Pull Request

We need a new pull request for every bugfix or feature that you wish to contribute.

Follow these steps for your features or fixes:

1. if you don't have one already, create an account on Github
2. on Github, fork our project
3. clone your fork to your local computer
4. create a new branch on your local computer: `git checkout -b feature/<my-feature> develop`
5. work on your feature
6. commit it, and push it back up to your fork

When you're ready to submit your pull request, please make sure it's a pull request against our `develop` branch.

## How We'll Check Your Pull Request

This project follows the [SafelyTyped Code Review Guidelines][code-review-guidelines].

We'll check your pull request for the following:

1. does the pull request address a single open GitHub issue?
2. does the pull request apply cleanly against our `develop` branch?
3. does it fit within the existing scope of the library?
4. does it fit our goals for the library?
5. does it meet our [coding standards][coding-standards]?
6. does it come will 100% unit test coverage?
7. does the pull request include updated docs showing how the new feature works?

If the answer is 'no' to any of those, we'll respond and let you know what we need you to do before we can accept your pull request.

## Accepted Contributions

If we accept your pull request, we'll add your details to our [authors](AUTHORS.md) page, so that your contribution is acknowledged. We'll also add details of your change to our [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) page.
